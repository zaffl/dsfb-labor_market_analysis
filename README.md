# Requirements and how to run the code
In order to run this you simply need to install Python >= 3.6 and Anaconda. If you have already install Python on your PC you can simply run this command to install Anaconda:
    
    pip install conda

Otherwise you can find some other ways to instal Anaconda on its [official site](https://anaconda.com/). 
Once you have done with it you can create a Conda Virtual Environment containing all the necessary library using the following command:

    conda create dsfb -n env.yml python=3.8 & conda activate dsfb

Then you can open the Jupyter Notebook in your browser running in your terminal

    jupyter-lab
